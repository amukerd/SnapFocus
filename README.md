# SnapFocus - [Install](https://github.com/amukerd/SnapFocus/raw/refs/heads/main/script.user.js) - You Need Tampermonkey!

## Very simple script to stop the div pictured below from being created when the tab/browser is unfocused
Unfortunately you can't just delete it once as it is recreated as soon as the div is deleted

## After some testing it also appears this has some effect on the div pictured below that shows up when taking a screenshot on web (shift + win + s)
It appears the screenshot div goes away faster and you don't have to press the keybind as fast
