# SnapFocus - [Install](https://github.com/amukerd/SnapFocus/raw/refs/heads/main/script.user.js) - You Need Tampermonkey!

## Very simple script to stop the div pictured below from being created when the tab/browser is unfocused
Unfortunately you can't just delete it once as it is recreated as soon as the div is deleted

## After some testing it also appears this has some effect on the div pictured below that shows up when taking a screenshot on web (shift + win + s)
Even though the div still shows up, it seems it goes away faster and you don't have to press the keybind as fast

Although you could just click the taskbar to unfocus the page and because of this script nothing would cover the chat window, so you could easily take a screenshot
